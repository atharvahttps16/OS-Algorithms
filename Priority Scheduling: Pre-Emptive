#Note


#To Switch Back to "Lower Value = Higher Priority"

# Step 01
#In sorting operations (sort calls in the function), replace -x.pr with x.pr
# Change this line:      ready_queue.sort(key=lambda x: -x.pr)  
# To:     ready_queue.sort(key=lambda x: x.pr)


# Step 02
#In the initial sorting of processes (processes.sort(...)), change -x.pr to x.pr
# Change this line:    processes.sort(key=lambda x: (x.at, -x.pr))
# To:    processes.sort(key=lambda x: (x.at, x.pr))
